Kernel Swappiness:

    The Linux kernel provides a tweakable setting that controls how often the
    swap file is used, called swappiness.
    
    A high value improves file-system performance, while aggressively swapping
    less active processes out of physical memory. A low value avoids swapping
    processes out of memory, which usually decreases latency, at the cost of I/O 
    performance.

    Ubuntu system's default value is 60. Systems with adequate RAM for any expected 
    task may want to drastically lower the setting.
