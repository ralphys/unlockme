Manage Save Sessions:

    You have probably noticed the "Save session for future logins"
    option in the shutdown dialog.\n
    Some users may inadvertently save their sessions on logout
    and become confused wondering why there are so many 
    applications popping up during login.\n
    As Administrator you can enable, limit or disable the ability
    to save sessions on logout.
