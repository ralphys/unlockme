IPv6:

    If your PC is connecting to a network that doesn't use or need IPv6 support,
    (most home networks for example) you can disable IPv6.\n
    IPv6 is short for "Internet Protocol Version 6". IPv6 is the Internet's
    next-generation protocol, designed to replace the current Internet Protocol,
    IP Version 4.\n
    In order to communicate over the Internet, computers and other devices must have
    sender and receiver addresses. These numeric addresses are known as Internet
    Protocol addresses. As the Internet and the number of people using it grows
    exponentially, so does the need for IP addresses.\n
