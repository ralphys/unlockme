IPv6:
    If your PC is connecting to a network that doesn't use or need IPv6 support,
    (most home networks for example) you can disable IPv6.\n
    IPv6 is short for "Internet Protocol Version 6". IPv6 is the Internet's
    next-generation protocol, designed to replace the current Internet Protocol,
    IP Version 4.\n
    In order to communicate over the Internet, computers and other devices must have
    sender and receiver addresses. These numeric addresses are known as Internet
    Protocol addresses. As the Internet and the number of people using it grows
    exponentially, so does the need for IP addresses.\n
    IPv6 is a standard developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force, an organization
    that develops Internet technologies. The IETF, anticipating the need for more IP
    addresses, created IPv6 to accommodate the growing number of users and devices
    accessing the Internet.\n 
    IPv6 allows more users and devices to communicate on the Internet by using bigger
    numbers to create IP addresses. Under IPv4, every IP address is 32 bits long, which
    allows 4.3 billion unique addresses. In comparison, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, 
    which allow for approximately three hundred and forty trillion, trillion unique IP
    addresses.
