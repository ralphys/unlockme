Browser cache:

    The browser cache, sometimes also referred to as the temporary Internet files
    folder, contains files from web sites youâ€™ve visited. All modern web browsers
    maintain a cache of files for one important reason - faster display of web pages
    the next time you open those web sites.

    Thus, instead of being retrieved from the online web server (the computer that
    hosts the web site) each time, the files are picked from the browser cache (on
    your computer) which speeds up the display of the web page.
