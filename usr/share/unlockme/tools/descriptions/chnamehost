Hostname:

    A hostname is the label (the name) assigned to a device (a host) on a network
    and is used to distinguish one device from another on a specific network or over
    the internet.\n
    The hostname for a computer on a home network may be something like UserLaptop,
    Guest-Desktop, or FamilyPC.\n
    Hostnames are also used by DNS servers so you can access a website by a common,
    easy-to-remember name to avoid having to remember a string of numbers
    (an IP address) just to open a website.
