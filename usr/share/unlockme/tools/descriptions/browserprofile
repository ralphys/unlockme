Browser Profile:

    Browsers save your personal information such as bookmarks, passwords, and
    user preferences in a set of files called your profile, which is stored in a
    separate location from the browser's installation files.

    This option can be used to remove browser's profiles not longer needed and might
    also be handy in cases where the profile becomes corrupt and needs to be reset.
