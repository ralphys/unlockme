zRAM:

    A module of the Linux kernel, previously called "compcache". 
    ZRAM increases performance by avoiding paging on disk and instead
    uses a compressed block device in RAM in which paging takes place
    until it is necessary to use the swap space on the hard disk drive. Since
    using RAM is faster than using disks, zram allows Linux to make more
    use of RAM when swapping/paging is required, especially on older 
    computers with less RAM installed.

Usage: 

    Configure zram block device as a swap device to eliminate need for
    physical swap device or swap file.

Benefits:

    Eliminates need for physical swap device. This beame popular when 
    netbooks first showed up. Zram (then compcache) allowed users to
    avoid swap shortening the lifespan of SSDs in these memory 
    constrained systems.

    A zram block device can be used for other applications other than swap,
    anything you might use a block device for conceivably.

Drawbacks:

    Once a page is stored in zram it will remain there until paged in, or
    invalidated. The first pages to be paged out will be the oldest pages 
    (LRU list), these are 'cold' pages that are infrequently access. As the 
    system continues to swap it will move on to pages that are warmer
    (more frequently accessed), these may not be able to be stored because
    of the swap slots consumed by the cold pages. What zram can not do 
    (compcache had the option to configure a block backing device) is to 
    evict pages out to physical disk. Ideally you want to age data out of the
    in-kernel compressed swap space out to disk so that you can use kernel
    memory for caching warm swap pages or free it for more productive use.
