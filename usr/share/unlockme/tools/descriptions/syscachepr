Kernel Cache Pressure:

    Defines how the system will choose to cache inode and dentry information over
    other data.\n
    Basically, this is access data about the filesystem. It is generally very costly
    to look up and also very frequently requested, so it's an excellent thing for
    your system to cache.\n
    At the default value (100), the kernel will attempt to reclaim dentries and
    inodes at a 'fair' rate with respect to pagecache and swapcache reclaim.\n
    Decreasing cache pressure causes the kernel to prefer to retain dentry and
    inode caches.\n 
    Increasing cache pressure beyond 100 causes the kernel to prefer to reclaim
    dentries and inodes.
