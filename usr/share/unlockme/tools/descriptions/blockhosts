Blacklist Generator:

    Downloads and aggregates a combination of actively maintained lists from
    GitHub to generate a custom blacklist.conf file used to block ads, adware,
    malware and tracking domains, via DNS. You can also whitelist and blacklist
    specific domains manually during the generation wizard.\n
    Undesirable domains are blocked using services already available in your system
    such as Network Manager and dnsmasq. When a blacklisted domain is requested, dnsmasq
    responds with a non-routable address that describes an invalid or unknown target.\n
    Optionally, you can enable DNS cache (see Enable DNS Cache tweak)
    for increased performance.
